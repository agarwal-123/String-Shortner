String Shortner React App.

Deployed on Heroku: https://string-shortner.herokuapp.com/

Base converstion algorithm is used for shortning the string.
As we were given 26 charachtered string, which is needed to be converted to a 62 charachtered alphanumeric string.
A simple base converstion from base 26 to base 10 and the base 10 to base 62 was used in backend.

Note : First charachter Should not be "a" . It is the limitation of the code . Example: "aaaa" is Invalid.
